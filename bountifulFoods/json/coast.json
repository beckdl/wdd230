It is known for its sandy beaches, surf-able waves, moderate climate, and large and diverse population. The region is defined by the coastal plains of several major rivers and is bounded by the Transverse Mountain Ranges that include the Santa Monica and Santa Susana Mountains. The south coast of California has extremely high levels of species diversity, many of which are unique to the region, and the greatest number of threatened and endangered species in the state."

This proximity of dense urban development and sensitive natural areas creates a unique set of issues for the Conservancy to address in this region."
