                The Design Principle of White Space and Clean Design is exemplified 
                in this website because I feel that it is very simple in its design.
                There is a good amount of white space between all the components of 
                the page and nothing on the page feels too close together or to far 
                apart.

            <p>
                The Design Principle of Hick's Law is exemplified in this website 
                because I feel that there really isn't too many choices to be made 
                on this hompage. There really is only two major decisions. You can 
                either put in your address of interest or you have the choice of 
                browsing a random area that the site has chosen. This really lessens 
                the stress of more decisions than necessary.

            <img src="images/byui.png" alt="BYUI Homepage">
            <p>
                The Design Principle of PARC, particularly alignment, is exemplified in 
                this website because I feel that looking at this website is nice and uniform.
                All of the major choices on this page are all aligned from the top to the 
                bottom to make it easy to look at each of the items one by one to know where it 
                is that you want to go next.
